# OOP'S
> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code where we organize our program around objects. Objects are like real-world thingsâ€”they have properties (data) and can perform actions (functions or methods). 

> In simple terms, OOP helps us build reusable and organized code by treating our programs like a collection of interacting objects, just like in real life.
| **Feature**                | **Prototype-Based Programming**                     | **Object-Based Programming**                    |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Central Concept**        | Objects created from other objects (prototypes)   | Objects are standalone and self-contained      |
| **Classes**                | Not used                                          | Not required                                   |
| **Inheritance**            | Done through prototypes                           | May not support inheritance                   |
| **Encapsulation**          | Supported                                         | Supported                                     |
| **Polymorphism**           | Achieved via prototypes                           | May not focus on polymorphism                 |
| **Dynamic Behavior**       | Objects and prototypes can be modified at runtime | Objects focus on their own behavior           |
| **Example Language**       | JavaScript                                        | JSON-like data models, JavaScript (basic use) |


## Is javascript protype or object based 
JavaScript is prototype-based at its core but can be used in an object-based way when inheritance is not needed.
