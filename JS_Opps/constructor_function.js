// prototype method for linking 
/* Prototype chain 
the prototype chain is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. 
This chain is formed by linking objects to their prototypes. When you try to access a property or method on an object, 
JavaScript first checks if the object has that property. If it doesnâ€™t, JavaScript checks the prototype of that object, and 
the search continues up the prototype chain until it reaches the Object.prototype at the top.
