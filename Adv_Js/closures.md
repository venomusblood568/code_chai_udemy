# Closures in JavaScript

## What is a Closure?
A **closure** is a function that remembers its **lexical scope**, even when executed outside of that scope. Closures allow functions to "remember" variables from their parent function.

## Example of Closure

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "I am from outer function";
  
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outerVariable
  }
  
  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Output: "I am from outer function"
```

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. **Data Privacy**
Closures allow private variables:

```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: () => console.log(++count),
    decrement: () => console.log(--count)
  };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment(); // Output: 1
myCounter.increment(); // Output: 2
myCounter.decrement(); // Output: 1
```

## Summary
- A **closure** "remembers" its lexical scope.
- Used for **data privacy**, **callbacks**, and **function factories**.
- Helpful for creating reusable, encapsulated code. ðŸš€
